# L4 Rolling Pulse Context

This file is the shared handoff ledger for the four staggered L4 engineering pulses.

## Rules
- Keep exactly the latest 4 pulse entries.
- At pulse START: read this file before acting.
- At pulse END: replace/update this file with the newest entry first and prune entries older than the latest 4.
- Each entry records: UTC timestamp, pulse minute, live PR/WU heads, actions completed, merges, CI/review state, blockers, remediation attempted, and next executable action.
- A blocker is an action trigger, not a stopping condition. Apply safe remediation immediately using available authorized write privileges and zero-extra-cost failover.
- Do not weaken security, CI, review, privacy, tenant, or release controls.
- Owner-only boundaries remain: new spend/PAYG, unavailable/expanded secrets, legal/business-policy decisions, destructive production operations, sensitive publication, explicit human production go/no-go, or irreducible product direction.
